<h1>Froggerish! Udacity Arcade Game Project</h1>

This game is based on the classic game Frogger and is a project I completed while completing my Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree.

This game was built with Javascript, CSS, HTML and love.

<h1>Game Play</h1>

You can clone, fork or simply download the Zip file to your local environment. The main functionality is in the JS directory with app.js, engine.js and resources.js.  To display and play Froggerish, open the index.html file.

Once the index.html file is opened in a browser, the enemy bugs will immediately start passing by on the stone tiles. The player will start at the bottom in the grass. 

Use the UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT keys to control the player. The objective is to get past the enemy bugs without getting squashed. If you get squashed, the player gets set back to the beginning. If you make it past the bugs and into the water, YOU WIN!
